<h1>Welcome to the Digitarot, where Maîtresse Sabine can read your fortune!</h1>

<p>Tarot has been practiced since the dinosaurs ruled the earth. Triceratops were considered especially clarivoyant.</p>

<p>In the 5th century, fjord-dwelling Huldufólk taught the Icelandic peoples the way of the Tarot. Troupes of harpsichordists emigrated to France, where the dark art was passed on.<p>

<p>Maîtresse Sabine has practiced Tarot since 1962, after she was introduced to the top taroteenie of the time, John F. Kennedy. She has a 87% success rate in selecting winning lottery numbers.</p>
